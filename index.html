                    There are many ways that you can care for your dog. Food and diet are extremely important, especially depending on the breed of your dog. Some owners find it easier to feed their dog a pure kibble diet, while others mix their diet up by adding in cooked or raw meat, fish, vegetables and rice. When thinking of adding in cooked meats, boiled chicken or lamb are good options but you want to be cautious of cooked bones or toxic substances such as onion sauces that might be present in the meat. Cooked pumpkin or raw grated carrot make a good addition to bulking out your dog's meal. Occasionally tinned sardines, tuna or salmon in spring water can be fed as a treat. Puppies 8 to 12 weeks need four meals a day. 3 to 6 months need three meals a day. 6 months to a year require two meals a day, it is important to remember that larger canines or those prone to bloat, it's better to feed two smaller meals.

                     When thinking of excercise you need to consider the age and breed of your dog. Puppies generally have way more energy and require excercise in short bursts. Since puppies are constantly growing, along with their attention span including short walks or play sessions throughout the day is a safer choice than going for one really long walk once a day.

                     When considering excercise for adult dogs, breed heavily influences the level of activity they will need. High energy breeds such as Border Collies, Australian Shepards, German Shepards will generally need a lot more stimulation than say a bulldog, pug or even a basset hound. It is a good idea to do your research into what breed of dog you'll be getting, so that you know what to expect when it comes to their energy level and specific needs. As your dog progresses in age, you also want to keep in mind any health issues and if so, talk with your vet about the appropriate excercise.

                        Grooming and handling are a big key to dog ownership. You can help your dog clean and reduce shedding with brushing. Check for fleas and ticks during warmer weather. When walking your dog, make sure you check the weather outside. If it is extremely hot outside, the pavement itself can and will burn their toe beans/paw pads. Housing your dog requires a warm, quiet place to rest away from drafts and anything that might be disruptive to your dog.
